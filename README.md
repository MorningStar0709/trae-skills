## About This Project

**Trae AI Agent Enhancements** is a Trae AI Agent rules and skills collection for [Trae IDE](https://www.trae.ai/). It provides Rule-based routing, professional Skills, and persistent Memory capabilities — transforming your Agent from "can do anything but unstable" to "fast when simple, rigorous when complex, always learning".

## Architecture

```
User Input → Rules (Routing & Constraints) → Skills (Execution) → Memory (Learning)
```

| Layer | Count | Responsibility |
|:------|:------|:---------------|
| **Rules** | 8 | Routing decisions, behavior constraints, environment handling |
| **Skills** | 34 | Professional toolboxes covering design → coding → debugging → commit → completion → memory |
| **Memory** | Core Memory + MCP Memory | Cross-session knowledge accumulation via dual-track system |

## Core Features

- **T-Shirt Sizing**: Automatic task classification (S/M/L) — small tasks are fast, large tasks are thorough
- **Closed-Loop Quality**: Every skill produces verifiable evidence — no "should be fine" allowed
- **Self-Improvement**: Lessons learned are stored in Core Memory — never repeat the same mistake
- **Chinese Team Ready**: Native Chinese triggers, domestic Git platform support, bilingual skill files
- **Windows Native**: PowerShell commands, port conflict recovery, path conventions

## Quick Start

### Method 1: npm install (Recommended)

Run this anywhere (installs to your home directory, global for all projects):

```
npx trae-agent-enhancements
```

Follow the interactive prompt to select your Trae edition:

| Edition | Install Location | Description |
|:--------|:-----------------|:------------|
| China (trae.cn) | `~/.trae-cn/rules/` + `~/.trae-cn/skills/` | Global, applies to all projects |
| International (trae.ai) | `~/.trae/rules/` + `~/.trae/skills/` | Global, applies to all projects |

You can also specify the edition directly with `--edition`:

```
npx trae-agent-enhancements --edition cn       # China edition
npx trae-agent-enhancements --edition intl     # International edition
npx trae-agent-enhancements --help             # View help
```

### Prerequisites (MCP)

Some skills require the following MCP Servers for full functionality:

| MCP Server | Purpose | Installation |
|:-----------|:--------|:-------------|
| **Everything Search** | Windows local file search | Add in Trae Settings → MCP, see everything-search skill for config |
| **Chrome DevTools MCP** | Browser automation, Console/Network/DOM debugging, performance analysis | Add `npx chrome-devtools-mcp` in Trae Settings → MCP |
| **MCP Memory Server** | Cross-session persistent memory via knowledge graph | Add in Trae Settings → MCP (see config below) |

> These MCPs power the `everything-search`, `chrome-devtools`, and `memory-kernel` skills. Without them, related skills will not work fully.

> If you are using Trae Solo, you may already have built-in MCP Memory — check before installing manually.

**MCP Memory Server config (add to Trae Settings → MCP):**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory": {
      "command": "cmd",
      "args": ["/c", "npx", "-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"],
      "env": {
        "MEMORY_FILE_PATH": "D:/AppData/Memory/memory.jsonl"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Method 2: Manual Install

```
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/MorningStar0709/trae-agent-enhancements.git

# Choose your edition and copy to the corresponding directory

# China edition (trae.cn)
cp -r trae-agent-enhancements/rules  ~/.trae-cn/rules
cp -r trae-agent-enhancements/skills ~/.trae-cn/skills

# International edition (trae.ai)
cp -r trae-agent-enhancements/rules  ~/.trae/rules
cp -r trae-agent-enhancements/skills ~/.trae/skills
```

## Skill Paths

| Path | Skills |
|:-----|:-------|
| **Design & Planning** | brainstorming → writing-plans → executing-plans / subagent-driven-development |
| **Debugging & Quality** | systematic-debugging → test-driven-development → verification-before-completion |
| **Completion & Evolution** | git-commit → finishing-a-development-branch → self-improvement |
| **Orchestration** | dispatching-parallel-agents, workflow-runner, find-docs |
| **Browser & Frontend** | chrome-devtools, frontend-design, chart-visualization, a11y-debugging |
| **Meta Skills** | skill-creator, skill-stability-review, skill-language-policy, creating-trae-rules |
| **Memory & Learning** | memory-kernel, self-improvement |

## Windows/Trae Adaptation

- **PowerShell Commands**: Primary syntax for Windows environments
- **Port Recovery**: netstat → taskkill → verify → retry
- **Path Conventions**: Forward slashes in globs, absolute paths with backslashes
- **Core Memory**: 20-entry limit per scope, auto-eviction for stale entries
- **MCP Memory**: Knowledge graph persistence via MCP Memory Server, path `D:/AppData/Memory/memory.jsonl`
