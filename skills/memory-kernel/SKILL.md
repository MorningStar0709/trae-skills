# Memory Kernel

## Overview

This skill governs the dual memory system:

| Layer | Backend | Scope | Lifetime |
|:------|:--------|:------|:---------|
| **Trae Core Memory** | Trae native | Current session | Ephemeral |
| **MCP Memory** | Knowledge Graph (JSONL) | Cross-session | Persistent |

Check MCP Memory before scanning the project from scratch.

## Use This Skill

- "你还记得吗" / "之前我们讨论过" / 跨会话记忆召回
- "校准记忆" / "同步记忆"（触发 Calibration Mode）
- 新会话，需要项目上下文再开始
- 已知项目，需要查架构/约定/用户偏好
- 任务中需要持久化新知识到跨会话记忆

## Do Not Use

- 当前文件树可见的琐碎事实
- 用户刚在当前消息中提供的信息
- 会话级别的临时状态
- MCP 工具确认不可用且 Core Memory 可用时（直接用 Core Memory，不浪费调用）
- 一次性调试步骤
- 临时变量名或文件路径
- 用户明确说不要记住的信息

## Input Contract

**Required Inputs:**
- 用户的自然语言查询或任务指令（Step 0 自动触发）
- 或用户显式说出"校准记忆" / "同步记忆"
- 或用户显式说出"你还记得吗" / "之前我们讨论过"

**Optional Inputs:**
- 实体命名约定（默认 `snake_case`，项目实体无前缀，公共实体加 `public_` 前缀）
- 实体类型约定：`project` / `pattern` / `preference` / `profile`

**Missing input handling:**
- **查询太泛**：先缩小搜索范围再重试
- **未指定项目上下文**：从当前 git remote 或目录名推断
- **MCP 工具不可用**：按三级降级链处理，不阻塞

## Execution Protocol

### Writing Standard

Every observation written to MCP Memory must pass these gates.

**Observation format:** `[YYYY-MM-DD] <content>`
- Timestamp is the date the observation was written or last verified.
- Content is a single, self-contained fact. One sentence per observation.

**Write-worthy (pass the gate):**
- Project architecture, tech stack, key design decisions
- Conventions (naming, patterns, workflows) that affect multiple files
- User preferences that persist across sessions
- Reusable solutions, recurring error patterns, root causes
- Entity relationships that structure the knowledge graph

**Not write-worthy (skip):**
- Current file tree structure (always re-scanable)
- Information the user just provided in the current message
- Session-only state (variable names, temp file paths)
- Trivial or self-evident facts ("this project uses Git")
- Secrets, tokens, passwords, API keys — NEVER

**Entity granularity:**
- One project entity per project. Add observations to it, do not create multiple project entities.
- One pattern entity per distinct solution. Merge related patterns — do not split a single concept across entities.
- One preference entity per user profile.
- Prefer growing existing entities over creating new ones.

**Update discipline:**
- Stale observation: `delete_observations` the old one, `add_observations` the corrected one (both with current timestamp).
- Entity relationship stale: `delete_relations` then `create_relations`.
- Entire entity invalid: only then `delete_entities`.

**Safety boundary — cross-project isolation:**
MCP Memory is a shared store. All projects share one knowledge graph.
- Only modify entities whose name matches the current project context (derived from `git remote` or directory name).
- `public_`-prefixed entities are shared across projects. Append observations to them but do NOT delete or rename them without explicit user confirmation.
- `delete_entities` and `delete_observations` are prohibited on entities that do not match the current project name or the `public_` prefix — if you encountered one via search, skip it and proceed.
- When in doubt (no git remote, ambiguous project identity), ask the user before writing, updating, or deleting any entity.

### Write Protocol

1. Check if the entity already exists via `mcp_memory_search_nodes`
2. If entity exists: use `mcp_memory_add_observations` to append new facts
3. If entity does not exist: use `mcp_memory_create_entities` with name, type, and initial observations
4. For relationships between entities, use `mcp_memory_create_relations`
5. Every observation must include a `[YYYY-MM-DD]` prefix. Same date for bulk updates.

Entity naming convention: use `snake_case`. Timestamps are in observations, not in entity names.
- **Project entities**: no prefix — named as the project name (e.g., `trae_agent_enhancements`)
- **Public entities**: prefix `public_` — reusable across projects (e.g., `public_chenxing`, `public_architecture_patterns`)

Entity type convention:
- `project` for project-level entities (tech stack, architecture, conventions) — project memory
- `pattern` for reusable solutions and decisions — public memory
- `preference` for user preferences — public memory
- `profile` for user identity — public memory

### Read Protocol (Step 0 Execution)

1. **Pre-flight check**: Verify whether `mcp_memory_search_nodes` is in the available tool list. If the tool is not registered, skip to Fallback Level 2 immediately — do not attempt the call.
2. **Level 0 (MCP available)**: Start with `mcp_memory_search_nodes` — use broad queries relevant to the task/project context. Search for project name, domain keywords, entity types (`project`, `pattern`, `profile`, `preference`).
   - If results are returned, open specific nodes with `mcp_memory_open_nodes` to get full observations
   - Assess whether the context is sufficient by checking both criteria:

     | Check | Question | Sufficient if... |
     |:------|:---------|:-----------------|
     | **Answer check** | Can the user's question be answered from MCP observations alone? | Yes |
     | **Task check** | Does MCP data provide enough project structure/convention/pattern context to proceed without project-wide discovery? | Yes |

     - **Both checks negative or empty**: Insufficient — proceed with normal task execution. Write new findings back afterward.
     - **At least one check positive**: Sufficient — skip project-wide file scanning. Only read 1-2 key files (e.g., `package.json`) to verify version/state changes.
   - If MCP call fails (timeout/error), fall back to Level 1.
3. **Level 1 (MCP unavailable, Core Memory available)**: Check if `manage_core_memory` tool is available. If yes, use Core Memory as a degraded context source.
4. **Level 2 (both unavailable)**: Skip all memory lookups. Choose fallback behavior based on task type:

   | Task type | Fallback |
   |:----------|:---------|
   | Single-file question, code explanation | Read current file(s) only |
   | Project overview, "what is this project" | Ask user briefly or read `docs/` / `README.md` |
   | Feature implementation, refactoring, bug fix | Full file scan + T-Shirt sizing |
   | Ambiguous request, "help me with..." | Ask user for context |
   | Conversational, greeting, meta | Respond directly |

   No memory write-back expected at Level 2.

### Update Protocol

When information in MCP Memory is found to be outdated:
1. Use `mcp_memory_delete_observations` to remove stale facts (identified by their timestamp prefix `[YYYY-MM-DD]`)
2. Use `mcp_memory_add_observations` to add corrected facts with the current date `[YYYY-MM-DD]`
3. Do NOT delete and recreate the entity unless the entire entity is invalid

### Calibration Mode (Manual Trigger)

When the user says "校准记忆" or "同步记忆", perform a targeted refresh:

1. Read key project files: `package.json`, `rules/` directory listing, `skills/` directory listing, `docs/` directory listing
2. Read the current project entity via `mcp_memory_open_nodes`
3. If entity does not exist (search returned empty):
   - Summarize what was found: project name from `package.json`, skill count, rule count, docs count
   - Ask user: "项目记忆为空，是否基于当前文件状态初始化？"
   - If confirmed: use `mcp_memory_create_entities` to create the project entity with initial observations from step 1
   - Then proceed to step 4 to confirm the diff
4. Compare observations (check timestamp prefix `[YYYY-MM-DD]` for staleness) against actual file state (or against the just-created entity):
   - Missing skills or rules → append via `mcp_memory_add_observations`
   - Outdated version numbers or descriptions → `mcp_memory_delete_observations` + `mcp_memory_add_observations`
   - Renamed or removed items → `mcp_memory_delete_observations`
5. Report the diff to the user before writing: "发现 X 处差异，是否更新？（列出差异明细）"
6. Only write changes after user confirmation

## Failure Handling

- **MCP tools unavailable (tool not registered)**: Pre-flight check catches this. Skip MCP entirely, attempt Level 1 or Level 2 (task-type-based fallback). Do not waste a call.
- **MCP tools unavailable (runtime failure)**: Fall back to Level 1 (Core Memory). If Core Memory also unavailable, Level 2 (task-type-based fallback). Do not block task execution.
- **Search returns no results**: Proceed with Level 0 insufficient path (normal execution). Write new findings back afterward.
- **Write fails**: Log the failed write and continue. The information can be re-captured later.
- **Duplicate entity**: The tools handle duplicates silently — no action needed.
- **Both Core Memory and MCP unavailable**: Level 2 — choose fallback based on task type (see Read Protocol table).

## Output Contract

When using MCP Memory (including Step 0 pre-check), include in your response:
- Whether Step 0 MCP Memory query was performed
- Whether context was sufficient (skipping file scan) or insufficient (triggering fallback)
- What relevant information was found (if any)
- What new information was persisted (if any)

## Integration

- `discovering-subagent-capabilities`: Adjacent — MCP Memory tools are platform-level, not subagent-level
- `self-improvement`: Downstream — persistent learnings from self-improvement should also be written to MCP Memory
