name: systematic-debugging
description: Use when debugging bugs, test failures, build breaks, performance regressions, or unclear behavior before proposing a fix, including Chinese requests such as “逐步排查”“为什么失败”“先定位原因”“不要先猜修复”. Do not use for straightforward implementation tasks, pure document edits, or issues that already have a confirmed root cause and only need mechanical changes.

# Systematic Debugging

## Use This Skill

- The user reports a bug, test failure, build break, abnormal behavior, or performance issue.
- You have already tried 1-2 fixes but the issue is not stably resolved.
- The issue spans multiple components, scripts, services, threads, or async boundaries.
- The user asks to "debug step by step", "locate the cause first", or "don't guess the fix".

## Do Not Use

- The user just wants you to implement a clear feature, with no abnormal or failing symptoms.
- The user is asking for a normal code review; prioritize `requesting-code-review` or the environment's code review process.
- The issue is already clear enough that only mechanical changes remain, needing no debugging.
- The failure is a Chrome DevTools MCP connection, startup, or missing tool issue; prioritize `troubleshooting`.

## Input Contract

**Required Inputs:**
- At least one observable symptom, such as an error message, failing test, abnormal behavior, performance degradation, or build failure.

**Optional but highly recommended inputs:**
- Reproduction steps.
- Error logs, stack traces, exit codes.
- Recent changes, environment differences, config differences.
- Expected behavior vs. actual behavior.

**Missing input handling:**
- **Symptoms insufficient to judge the issue**: Clarify the phenomenon first; do not modify code directly.
- **Unable to reproduce stably**: Prioritize adding observation points and finding the minimal reproduction path.
- **Only "please fix it" without failure evidence**: Collect evidence first, then decide whether to enter the fix phase.

## Execution Protocol

### 1. Read the Symptom

Read the phenomenon itself completely first:
- Error messages, stack traces, failing test names, exit codes.
- Time of first occurrence and trigger conditions.
- Whether it reproduces stably.
- Recent code, config, dependency, or environment changes.

If the symptom is unclear, clarify it. Do not start fixing.

### 2. Reproduce Stably

Record minimal reproduction steps.
Narrow down inputs, scope, and target files as much as possible.
If it cannot be reproduced stably, continue adding logs and observation points instead of changing code directly.

### 3. Establish Evidence Chain

Record inputs, outputs, and state for each suspicious boundary:
- What was received before entering the component.
- What was produced after leaving the component.
- Whether environment variables, configs, thread states, and network results are passed correctly.
- At which layer it starts deviating from expectations.

Multi-layer system example:
```powershell
Write-Host "=== Workflow layer ==="
Write-Host ("IDENTITY: " + ($(if ($env:IDENTITY) { "SET" } else { "UNSET" })))

Write-Host "=== Build script layer ==="
Get-ChildItem Env:IDENTITY -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

Write-Host "=== Signing step ==="
& codesign --sign $env:IDENTITY --verbose=4 $env:APP
```

### 4. Compare with Normal Path

Find a "working similar implementation" first, then compare differences:
- Normal tests, commands, or modules in the same repository.
- Reference implementations under the same pattern.
- Differences in dependencies, initialization order, config values, or boundary conditions.
Base conclusions on traceable differences, not intuition.

### 5. Propose a Single Hypothesis

Keep only one root cause hypothesis at a time, formatted as explicitly as possible:
```text
I believe X is the root cause because Y; if this judgment is correct, then minimal validation should show Z.
```
Then do only one minimal validation. Do not stack multiple fixes simultaneously.

### 6. Write Failing Validation First, Then Fix

Once the root cause is clear:
- Prioritize writing a failing test or minimal reproduction script.
- Fix only the root cause; do not refactor unrelated things along the way.
- Re-run the reproduction path and related tests after the fix.

This step should integrate with `test-driven-development`.

### 7. Fallback on Fix Failure

- 1st validation failure: Update hypothesis, return to Step 3.
- 2nd validation failure: Expand evidence scope, re-check the call chain.
- 3rd validation failure: Stop "trying one more time", start questioning the architecture or approach itself.

## Trae / Windows Conventions

- In Trae, prioritize using `Read`, `Grep`, `SearchCodebase`, `GetDiagnostics`, and `RunCommand` to collect evidence.
- When these tools fail due to MCP unavailability, refer to `environment-resilience` rule for the graceful MCP degradation chain (retry → terminal fallback → report).
- When a command fails due to port conflicts or zombie processes, refer to `port-conflict-recovery` rule (identify → kill → verify → retry).
- When running commands on a Windows host, use PowerShell-compatible syntax; only use POSIX syntax when the command explicitly runs inside a container, remote Linux, or WSL.
- When needing to clarify reproduction steps, input conditions, or environment differences, use structured questions in the current environment instead of guessing.
- If a fix needs to be implemented later, switch to `test-driven-development`; if preparing to declare it fixed, switch to `verification-before-completion`.

## Red Lines

If you see these thoughts, return to the investigation phase immediately:
- "Let's fix it temporarily first, and look at it later."
- "I guess the problem is here, let's change it and see."
- "Let's change several places at once and run the tests."
- "Skip the tests, let's click manually to see."
- "Although I don't understand it yet, this change will probably work."
- "Let's try one more time" when you have already tried more than twice.

## Failure Handling

- **Cannot reproduce**: Add logs, state outputs, or minimize inputs; do not fix directly.
- **Missing context**: Confirm environment, data, commands, and expected behavior with the user.
- **External dependencies unstable**: Explicitly mark dependency risks and isolate locally verifiable parts.
- **More than three fix attempts fail**: Stop patching locally and switch to an architectural discussion.

## Output Contract

After completing the debugging phase, the output must contain at least:
- Phenomenon: What exactly failed.
- Evidence: What logs, command outputs, or code differences you saw.
- Root Cause Hypothesis: What is the most credible cause currently.
- Validation: How you prove or disprove this hypothesis.
- Next Steps: Enter fix, continue collecting evidence, or request clarification.

Use this fixed skeleton by default:

```markdown
调试阶段已完成。

**Phenomenon:**
- [What failed]

**Evidence:**
- [Logs / command outputs / code diffs]

**Most Credible Root Cause Hypothesis:**
- [If not yet located, write `- Not yet located`]

**Validation Actions:**
- [How to prove or disprove]

**Next Steps:**
- [If verified: Enter `test-driven-development` for high-risk fixes, or `executing-plans` for straightforward changes / If unverified: Propose next diagnostic step / If blocked: Ask for missing context]
```

If the root cause is not yet located, do not output a fix.

> **Context Payload (for downstream handoff)**
>
> When handing off to the next skill (e.g., `test-driven-development`, `executing-plans`), append this context block to the output. It preserves the debugging journey so the fix agent does not lose prior context:
>
> ```markdown
> **[Context Payload]**
> **Phenomenon:** [What exactly failed]
> **Root Cause:** [Confirmed hypothesis or "not yet located"]
> **Ruled Out:** [What was investigated and discarded, to avoid repeat work]
> **Evidence Collected:** [Logs, command outputs, code diffs — or paths to them]
> **Residual Risk:** [What is still uncertain, what edge cases remain]
> **Affected Components:** [Files, services, or layers involved]
> **Fix Guidance:** [One-sentence summary of what needs to change]
> ```

If the root cause is non-obvious or the debugging uncovered a subtle system behavior, invoke `self-improvement` to log the finding as a `knowledge_gap` or `insight` before exiting.

## Integration

- `executing-plans`: Downstream — for straightforward fixes where the root cause is clear and no complex implementation plan is needed.
- `writing-plans`: Downstream — for complex root cause fixes that need architectural design or multi-step planning before execution.
- `verification-before-completion`: Downstream — re-verify whether the conclusion is supported by evidence after fixing.
